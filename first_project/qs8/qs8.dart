  //What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?

// 1- num
// we can declare any number by num (int,float,double) and code will run without error
num num1= 12;
print(num1);
num num2 = 12.5;
print(num2);

//2- double
// we can declare decimal number only , can't declare int
double x = 12.5;
print(x);
